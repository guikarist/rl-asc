# Modified Baselines

This is a fork of OpenAI Baselines which includes three new algorithms: `modified_deepq`, `modified_a2c` and `modified_ppo`, that are modified from original `deepq`, `a2c` and `ppo2` respectively. Only some settings of the three original ones are modified. 

For guide of usage, see [the original README](README_original.md).
