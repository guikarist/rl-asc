# Modified Baselines

This is a fork of OpenAI Baselines which includes three new algorithms: `modified_deepq`, `modified_a2c` and `modified_ppo`, that are modified from original `deepq`, `a2c` and `ppo2` respectively. Only some settings of the three original ones are modified. 

## Usage

For installation of some prerequisites, see [the original README](README_baselines.md).

To run three modified algorithms, you can just run entries whose names are `run_modified_*.py` in the root directory. For details of usage, run `python run_modified_*.py --help`.
